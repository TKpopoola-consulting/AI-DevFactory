We are building an AI-powered application development platform called **AI DevFactory**. The system takes natural language prompts and automatically generates full-stack applications (frontend, backend, infrastructure, and deployment pipelines).

The original design used Firebase for the backend, but the user is now asking about using Azure instead. Let's restructure the backend for Azure.

### Key Components to Re-architect for Azure:

1. **Authentication**: Replace Firebase Authentication with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Azure B2C.

2. **Database**: Replace Firestore with Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL) or Azure SQL Database.

3. **Cloud Functions**: Replace Firebase Cloud Functions with Azure Functions.

4. **File Storage**: Replace Firebase Cloud Storage with Azure Blob Storage.

5. **Hosting**: Replace Firebase Hosting with Azure Static Web Apps or Azure App Service.

6. **Orchestration and Agents**: Can be hosted on Azure Container Instances (ACI) or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for containerized agents.
### Proposed Azure Backend Structure:

```

/backend/

/functions/ (Azure Functions)

createJob/            # HTTP trigger for job creation

function.json

index.js (or TypeScript)

submitFeedback/       # HTTP trigger for feedback

getJobStatus/         # HTTP trigger for job status

finalizeJob/          # HTTP trigger for finalizing job

/orchestrator/ (Shared library for orchestration logic, used by functions)

jobRouter.ts

agentSelector.ts

keyVaultHelper.ts     # Uses Azure Key Vault

costOptimizer.ts

/agents/ (Each agent is a containerized application)

frontend_agent/       # Docker container for frontend generation

Dockerfile

app/ (agent code)

backend_agent/        # Docker container for backend generation

infra_agent/          # Docker container for infra generation

qa_agent/             # Docker container for QA (future)

/utils/ (Shared utilities)

workspaceManager.ts   # Uses Azure Repos or GitHub for versioning
githubClient.ts       # If using GitHub

blobClient.ts         # Azure Blob Storage client

errorHandler.ts

/config/

agents.json           # Agent configurations

deployment.json       # Azure deployment config (e.g., regions, resource groups)

```

### Database Schema (Using Azure Cosmos DB or Azure SQL)

We'll design for Cosmos DB (NoSQL) for flexibility and scalability. Collections (containers in Cosmos DB) would be:

1. **Jobs Container** (Partition key: `/userId`)

```json

{

"id": "job123", // Unique job ID
"userId": "user1", // Partition key

"createdAt": "2025-06-07T12:00:00Z",

"status": "processing",

"currentAgent": "frontend_agent",

"outputConfig": {

"platforms": ["web", "android"],

"frameworks": ["flutter"],

"cloudTarget": "azure"

},

"artifacts": {

"frontend": "https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/jobs/job123/frontend.zip",

"backend": "...",

"infra": "...",
"buildLogs": "..."

},

"costMetrics": {

"aiTokens": 4500,

"computeSec": 120,

"storageMB": 10

}

}

```

2. **Feedback Container** (Partition key: `/jobId`)

```json

{

"id": "feedback456",
"jobId": "job123",

"content": "The generated code had a bug in the login screen.",

"timestamp": "2025-06-07T12:30:00Z",

"fileRefs": [

"https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/feedback/feedback456/screenshot.png"

],

"resolution": "pending"

}

```

3. **AuditLogs Container** (Partition key: `/jobId` or `/timestamp` for time-based queries)

```json

{

"id": "log789",

"jobId": "job123",
"jobId": "job123",

"event": "agent_started",

"message": "Frontend agent started processing",

"timestamp": "2025-06-07T12:05:00Z",

"agentId": "frontend_agent",

"processingTime": 45

}

```

### Authentication Flow with Azure:

1. Frontend uses MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library) to authenticate users via Azure AD.

2. On successful login, frontend receives an access token.

3. Frontend includes the token in the `Authorization` header when calling Azure Functions.

4. Azure Functions validate the token using Azure AD.

### Agent Deployment:### Agent Deployment:

- Each agent (frontend, backend, infra) is built as a Docker container.

- Containers are stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

- Agents can be run on:

- **Azure Container Instances (ACI)**: For simpler, per-job scaling.

- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: For more complex orchestration and scaling.

### File Storage:

- **Azure Blob Storage** for:

- Storing job artifacts (generated code, build logs)

- Feedback attachments

### CI/CD:

- Use **Azure DevOps Pipelines** or **GitHub Actions** to deploy:

- Azure Functions

Container images to ACR

- Infrastructure (via ARM templates or Terraform)

### Key Changes from Firebase to Azure:

1. **Authentication**: Firebase Auth → Azure AD

2. **Database**: Firestore → Azure Cosmos DB

3. **Functions**: Firebase Functions → Azure Functions

4. **Storage**: Firebase Storage → Azure Blob Storage

5. **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting → Azure Static Web Apps (for Flutter Web) or App Service

6. **Agents**: Run as containers in ACI/AKS instead of Firebase (which doesn't have direct container support)

### Implementation Steps:

1. Set up Azure resources:

- Azure AD application for authentication.

- Azure Cosmos DB account and containers (jobs, feedback, auditLogs).

- Azure Storage account for blobs.
- Azure Key Vault for secrets (like API keys for Gemini, GitHub tokens).

2. Rebuild the backend functions as Azure Functions (TypeScript/JavaScript).

3. Containerize the agents and deploy to ACR.

4. Update frontend services (`api_service.dart`) to use Azure endpoints and Azure AD authentication.

5. Set up deployment pipelines.

This architecture leverages Azure's strengths in enterprise applications, container orchestration, and integration with other Microsoft tools. It also provides the scalability and security required for an AI development platform.
